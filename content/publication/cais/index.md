abstract: This paper describes the experiences of two business faculty who taught two different levels of undergraduate business analytics courses during the COVID\-19 pandemic. In particular, we focus on two challenges that arose during the shift to Emergency Remote Teaching, *student engagement* and *teaching the use of software*. We discuss our efforts to mitigate the effects of these problems and highlight the differences in implementing our strategies in a general-education (i.e., required for business majors) course versus an upper-level elective. Finally, we discuss lessons learned and recommendations for other educators regardless of their teaching modality.
