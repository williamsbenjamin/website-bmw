abstract: Although postural control deficits are common following a concussion, the current clinical assessments for postural control tend to resolve within 3 to 10 days after injury. There is a lack of sensitive tools to examine subtle changes in postural controlduring the recovery phase following sports-related concussion. Only a limited number of studies have examined nonlinear dynamicsof postural control; no study has examined this metric longitudinally during the recovery phase following a sports-related concussion.
